# Community support

This page shows community support.
We show the tools and ML algorithms around `AWML`.
`AWML` is based on [Autoware Core & Universe strategy](https://autoware.org/autoware-overview/).
We hope that this page promote the community between Autoware and ML researchers and engineers.

After we publish as open-source software, we set up this page.

## Library
### (TBD) autoware-ml-prediction

- autoware-ml-prediction

We are implementing `autoware-ml-prediction` for now, which aims to deploy ML-based prediction model for Autoware.

## Tool
### mm-project-template

- [mm-project-template](https://github.com/scepter914/mm-project-template/tree/main)

This repository is the project template based on [mm series](https://github.com/open-mmlab).
You can start from this template and you can add code of `/tools/*` and `/projects/*` from `AWML` to use for your a new algorithm or a new tool.
